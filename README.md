# üß∞ IT Toolbox

Welcome to **IT Toolbox** ‚Äî a light-weight, all-in-one utility suite built in Python with a functional GUI.

This is my first full-stack project combining Python tools with a simple webpage showcasing the project. I'm actively developing it and would love your feedback!

## üîß Tools Included

Each Python tool lives in the `Tools/` folder and is built to help with everyday IT support or diagnostics.

| Tool Name         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IPConfig.py`     | Displays the system's IP configuration (equivalent to `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`). |
| `PCHealth.py`     | Basic system health check (disk usage, memory, etc.).                      |
| `PortScan.py`     | Scans open ports on a target IP.                                           |
| `PWGenerator.py`  | Generates secure random passwords.                                         |

## üåê Web Front-End

The `web/` folder contains a simple webpage that includes:
- A breakdown of each tool
- Potential tools to come
- Links to other projects and webpages made by me!

## üöß Status

This is a **work in progress**. I'm planning to:
- Improve the UI
- Add error handling
- Bundle as an executable toolkit
- Create 'logging' for various tools
